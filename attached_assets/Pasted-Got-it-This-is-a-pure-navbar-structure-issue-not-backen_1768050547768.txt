Got it 👍
This is a **pure navbar structure issue**, not backend — and the fix is **simple and clean**.

Right now:

* **Cryptocurrency is inside “Market Segments” (dropdown)**
* You want:

  * **Cryptocurrency as its OWN top-level navbar item**
  * Just like **Market News**, **Personal Finance**, etc.

We’ll do this **without breaking anything else**.

# 🎯 FINAL NAVBAR STRUCTURE (WHAT YOU WANT)

```
Home
Market News
Cryptocurrency   ← separate
Personal Finance
IPO
Stock Ideas
```

(And Market Segments dropdown stays as-is or can exclude crypto.)

# 🧩 STEP 1: REMOVE CRYPTO FROM MARKET SEGMENTS DROPDOWN

Open your navbar file
(`header.ejs`, `navbar.ejs`, or HTML)

Find **Market Segments dropdown**, something like:

```html
<li class="dropdown">
  <a href="#">Market Segments</a>
  <ul class="dropdown-menu">
    <li><a href="/category/large-cap">Large Cap</a></li>
    <li><a href="/category/mid-cap">Mid Cap</a></li>
    <li><a href="/category/cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</a></li> <!-- REMOVE THIS -->
  </ul>
</li>
```

### ❌ DELETE this line:

```html
<li><a href="/category/cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</a></li>
```

---

# 🧩 STEP 2: ADD CRYPTOCURRENCY AS A TOP-LEVEL NAV ITEM

Now add this **outside any dropdown**, just like others:

```html
<li>
  <a href="/category/cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</a>
</li>
```

📌 Place it near **Market News** / **Personal Finance**.

---

# 🧩 STEP 3: (OPTIONAL) STYLE IT SAME AS OTHERS

If your navbar CSS uses a class (example):

```html
<li class="nav-item">
  <a class="nav-link" href="/category/cryptocurrency">Cryptocurrency</a>
</li>
```

Use the **same class names** as other main items.

---

# 🧩 STEP 4: VERIFY ROUTE (IMPORTANT)

You already have this route (from earlier):

```js
app.get("/category/:category", ...)
```

So:

```
/category/cryptocurrency
```

✔ Works automatically
✔ No backend changes needed

---

# 🧠 WHY THIS HAPPENED

Because **navbar ≠ CMS**.

* Admin panel controls **content**
* Navbar controls **navigation**

Even Trade Brains:

* Same category appears in multiple menus
* Controlled only by frontend layout

---

# ✅ FINAL CHECKLIST

✔ Crypto appears as **top-level navbar item**
✔ Not inside Market Segments
✔ Clicking it shows only crypto posts
✔ Admin posting remains unchanged
✔ Search & SEO unaffected

---

# 🚀 NEXT IMPROVEMENTS (OPTIONAL)

If you want, next we can add:

* Crypto dropdown (Bitcoin, Altcoins, Web3)
* Crypto price widget
* Trending crypto articles
* Sticky Crypto label
* Highlight Crypto in navbar when active

Just tell me what you want next 👌
